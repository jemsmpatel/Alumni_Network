                        The word 'Navnirman' symbolises 'Reconstruction'. About 40 years back, the people of this area
                        were
                        economically & socially backward, the literacy rate was very low & there was lack of awareness &
                        education
                        amongst the women. The aim of the trust is to carry various activities for all round upliftment
                        in social,
                        economic, cultural & educational fields without any discriminate of caste, creed or religion.
                        The main aim
                        is to serve the community.
                        With the aim to eradicate the social evils prevailing in the society, whose main cause was lack
                        of
                        education, the trust took up the activities of establishing institutes, to enlighten the minds
                        of people by
                        imparting knowledge & education. The first step in educational field was by starting NAVNIRMAN
                        UTTAR-BUNYADI
                        VIDHYALAYA, Bharthana in 1967, followed by establishing various educational institutes, right
                        from
                        pre-primary to college that too in various faculties, so that there could be an all round
                        development of
                        child, there could be physical, mental, cultural Social development & when the child is out of
                        the institute
                        he is able to earn livelihood & support for himself & his family.
